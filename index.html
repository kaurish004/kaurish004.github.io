  <!-- PROJECTS -->
  <section>
  <h2>Projects</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Network Vulnerability Scanning Tool</h3>
    <p class="tech">Python | Networking | Cybersecurity</p>
    <p>
      Designed and implemented a basic network vulnerability scanning tool to identify
      active hosts and open ports within a given network range. The project focuses on
      understanding common network exposure points and reconnaissance techniques used
      during security assessments.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project enhanced my knowledge of TCP/IP protocols, port states, and ethical
      vulnerability discovery practices while emphasizing responsible security testing.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Password Security Analysis System</h3>
    <p class="tech">Python | Security Analysis</p>
    <p>
      Developed a password security analysis system that evaluates passwords based on
      length, complexity, entropy, and resistance to common attack patterns. The system
      helps users understand secure authentication practices and the importance of strong
      credential management.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this project, I gained deeper insight into authentication vulnerabilities
      and defensive security strategies used to prevent credential-based attacks.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Network Traffic Analysis Using Wireshark</h3>
    <p class="tech">Wireshark | Network Protocols | Security Monitoring</p>
    <p>
      Conducted detailed network traffic analysis using Wireshark to study packet flow,
      protocol behavior, and potential security anomalies within a controlled environment.
      The project involved capturing and analyzing HTTP, TCP, UDP, and DNS traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work strengthened my understanding of network monitoring, intrusion indicators,
      and how abnormal traffic patterns can signal potential security threats.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Cybersecurity Awareness and Best Practices Website</h3>
    <p class="tech">HTML | CSS | Cybersecurity Fundamentals</p>
    <p>
      Created an informational website aimed at educating users about common cyber threats
      such as phishing, malware, weak passwords, and social engineering attacks. The site
      presents practical prevention techniques and security best practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project improved my ability to communicate technical security concepts clearly
      while promoting ethical awareness and responsible digital behavior.
